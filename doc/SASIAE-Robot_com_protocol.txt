From SASIAE to Robot:
     "T xxx yyy\n" : synchronization command, xxx must be microseconds since the simulation started, yyy is the amount of iteration of robotLoop to execute
     "B\n" : begin the match
     "D xxx yyy\n" : send yyy message to xxx named device
     "S\n" : stop the simulation

From Robot to SASIAE:
     "D xxx yyy\n" : send yyy message to xxx named 
     "M t xxx\n" : t among I(nfo), W(arning), E(rror) or D(ebug), xxx is the message
     "T" : notify the coordinator that the robot has finished executing its step

For "D xxx yyy\n" messages, yyy must be:
    - "init v v v ..."
    - "value v"
    - "ivalues i:v i:v i:v ..."
    - "values v v v ..."

If v is a string, it must be surrounded by " (double-quotes), double-quotes and \ (backslashes) must be escaped with a \.
String shouldn't contain new-line character (ASCII code 10) by any means.
